# Prompt Style Guide
- One clear instruction per sentence when possible.
- Define role (system) when it materially changes output.
- Add *constraints* (length, format) explicitly.
- Include *evaluation criteria* for repeatability.
- Prefer declarative phrasing over chatty filler for reusable prompts.
